# Sorting

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. This is a comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, causing larger elements to "bubble up" to their correct position, much like bubbles rising in water
